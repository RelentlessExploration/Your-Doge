# Shibe - primary server of Your Doge

The purpose of this is to distribute/route users to different servers as the amount of data per heroku db is [**_`limited`_**](https://your-doge.netlify.app). It also stores user data and all that relatively-small-amount stuff because I believe I'm not going to have 9800 + users.
